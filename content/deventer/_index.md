We live in the beautiful city of [Deventer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deventer). We still consider our selves tourists in our home town. Deventer sports a nice selection of good restaurants. A lot of our reviews are about restaurants in or near Deventer. Besides the old medieval city, good food and a nice shopping experience you should also visit Deventer because:

[Dickens festijn](https://dickensfestijn.nl/english/) *Just before christmas* the largest Dickens festival in the world according to the BBC, so it must be true. 

  
[Deventer op Stelten](https://www.deventeropstelten.nl/index.php/english) *In June or July* A free large open air high quality street theatre festival. With theatre groups from all over Europe.

[Deventer Boekenmarkt](https://www.deventerboekenmarkt.nl/) (In Dutch) *On the first sunday of August* A very large open air book market. Deventer used to be and still is a city of book shops, printing companies and publishers.
