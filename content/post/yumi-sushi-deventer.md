Yesterday evening we decided to go out grab some sushi at [Yume Sushi Deventer](http://www.yumesushi.nl/deventer/) Boreelplein 52.

### Table âœ” Service ðŸ’¨

We had no reservations. We just walked in. The lady at the counter walked us to our table and left us with nothing, no food, no drink, not even an activation code for the tablet.

For those that never have been to YuMe they work with a tablet, it needs to be activated to be able to order a drink, Sushi or even to call for assistance.

After about 10 minutes, my husband got the attention of the waiters. We asked her to activate the tablet. She left, we had to wait another 5 minutes without knowing what was going on.

We decided to leave when another waiter came to activate the tablet. She asked us if we made reservations. This sounded a bit strange in our ears and Hans stood up and was ready to leave, but this waitress kept very calmly and friendly. We decided to stay.

### Food

The Sushi was nice, not too big, not too small, a bit too much sauce. We saw some basic tricks that they do to get people to drink and eat less but that is a story for a different time.
