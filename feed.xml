&lt;h3 id=&quot;table--service-&quot;&gt;Table ‚úî Service üí®&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had no reservations and we just walked in. The lady at the counter walked us to our table and left us with nothing, no food, no drink, not even an activation code for the tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that never have been to YuMe they work with a tablet, it needs to be activated to be able to order a drink, Sushi or even to call for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 10 minutes my husband got the attention of the waiters and he asked her to activate the tablet. She left and we had to wait another 5 minutes without knowing what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to leave when another waiter came to activate the tablet. She asked us if we made reservations. This sounded a bit strange in our ears and Hans stood up and was ready to leave, but this waitress kept very calmly and friendly so we decided to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;food&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sushi was nice, not too big, not too small, a bit too much sauce and we saw some basic tricks that they do to get people to drink and eat less but that is a story for a different time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;strong&gt;Angela &amp;amp; Hans Kruse&lt;/strong&gt; and we are here to share our passion for good food. Telling our story, restaurant reviews and more. About what we‚Äôve seen. Not only about the food but also about the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A little disclaimer seems to be nessersarry. We are not professionals, just food lovers (We are level 6 and 8 at Google local guide). It‚Äôs just our experience, our oppinion in that moment, this does not mean that you will experience the same thing or that a restaurant can‚Äôt improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that you would like to go on this journey with us.
we would also love hearing your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;canard-presse&quot;&gt;Canard Presse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canard Presse is named after the French &lt;em&gt;Canard √† la presse&lt;/em&gt;, English
Pressed duck is a traditional French dish. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressed_duck&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were inspired by the late Anthony Bordain‚Äôs TV/Netflix show &lt;em&gt;The Layover - Season 1, episode 2, Paris&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Anthony&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bourdain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;happily&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;treats&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;himself&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duck&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;home&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;New&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;York&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sadly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;soon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;we&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;saw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Anthony&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Bourdain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commited&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Hans‚Äô dad got ill and we had to travel a lot to provide care for both Hans‚Äôs parents. We did not always have time to cook ourselves. We did not fancy fastfood, microwave meals or take away meals every day. To eat healthy we sometimes did buy salad meals or eat at not too expensive (sushi) restaurants. Sometimes we threated ourselves on really good restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started to notice quality differences between the different cheaper restaurants. We joked about making a blog post with the top 13 tricks an ‚ÄúAll you can eat restaurant‚Äù performs to make you consume less. Now we finally have time and energy to blog again we probably will write that post one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we started posting reviews on Google maps reviews. We noticed people liked our reviews and also, non verbal, we got the impression that restaurant staff read our reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deventer&quot;&gt;Deventer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in the beautiful city of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deventer&quot;&gt;Deventer&lt;/a&gt;. We still consider our selves tourists in our home town. Deventer sports a nice selection of good restaurants. A lot of our reviews are about restaurants in or near Deventer. Besides the old medieval city, good food and a nice shopping experience you should also visit Deventer because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dickensfestijn.nl/english/&quot;&gt;Dickens festijn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Just before christmas&lt;/em&gt; the largest Dickens festival in the world according to the BBC, so it must be true.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deventeropstelten.nl/index.php/english&quot;&gt;Deventer op Stelten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;In June or July&lt;/em&gt; A free large open air high quality street theatre festival. With theatre groups from all over Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deventerboekenmarkt.nl/&quot;&gt;Deventer Boekenmarkt&lt;/a&gt; (In Dutch) &lt;em&gt;On the first sunday of August&lt;/em&gt; A very large open air book market. Deventer used to be and still is a city of book shops, printing companies and publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-review-rules&quot;&gt;Our review rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We think we are fair and honest in our reviews. If you think we threat you unfair in our reviews please contact us&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We do not rate a fast food restaurant the same as posh 3 star restaurant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If something is wrong we tell staf immediately, before posting something on the internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a restaurant is in or near Deventer we try to visit it 2 or 3 times before posting a review. (Unless it is really bad or is really expensive).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In general we pay for our meals ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes Hans has to eat out for a business trip. Meals in restaurants payed by the employer are not threated different.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When offered a free meal for whatever reason (only happened once after a bad review) we post that it was sponsored as first sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In more expensive restaurants we think, can we make it our selves: technically or economically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;
