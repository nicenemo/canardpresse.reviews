Our dog loved it.\n\nWe did not try the food. I did not smell a thing so it must be good.\n\nThe menu outside states you can order a flat white. The lady serving had no idea what it was. I explained, but probably not good enough or was it my terrible Dutch accent? I received a double espresso with a tiny jug of cold milk. Almost right! Next time steam the milk on top of the coffee not as good but smar in a place like yours use a milk foam maker for more speedy service."}
