Dogs allowed in the beautiful outdoor seating. Friendly staff.\nClean toilets. Confusing queueing mechanism.\n\nWe ordered a second round of cold coffee.I consider Â£ 10,- very expensive  for 2  premade coffee in a package. Especially when  one came out of non cold storage.  Otherwise it would be 4 ðŸŒŸ. Their fresh made coffee is cheaper.\n\nEdits: made clear that the 10 GBP was for 2 coffee after a mail by the owner.\n\n To clarify our point, 5 GBP for one simple cold coffee  is expensive. I initially thought it was something different. It is a brand that is maybe only sold in the UK . I have not seen it in France, Belgium, Germany or the Netherlands. I expect that price level, for a good flat white because that takes extra work.  The guy after the counter should not have tried selling me an uncooled package d drink or at least have asked. This review is not harsh but factual.\n\n5 star for good location, cakes and home made iced coffee. However..\n\n-1 for overpriced packaged coffee\n\n-1 for selling 1 uncooled packaged coffee\n\n-1 for the banquette, that excellent stilton cheese really deserves better bread\n\n2 star remaining."}
