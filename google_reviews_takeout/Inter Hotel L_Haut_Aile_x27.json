{"title":"Inter Hotel L'Haut'Aile","date":"2019-08-22T19:00:58.761Z","address":"ZAC Les Terrasses, Avenue des Longues Pi√®ces, 62231 Coquelles, France","review":"Nice hotel for a night sleep before crossing the channel via the tunnel. Clean rooms, affordable. Free but limited and slow internet.\n\nThey allow dogs. It is outside the village in an office park/rural  area just beyond the fences of the channel tunnel compound. Shopping mall is 15 minutes walk.\n\nWhen walking your dog, be aware of the many  rabbits, alive but also dead. The area seems infested with them.\n\nCannot comment on dining or breakfast since we were with our dog and ate elsewhere."}
