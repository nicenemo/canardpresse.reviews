All made from scratch. Skillful with the dough. Clean shop, friendly people. Good value for money. Sadly they do not sell Ayran. Also I only saw one kind of cheese. The donor is made of pork meat. So if you desire halal or just like sheep or chicken doner, you should shop elsewhere. They have takeaway but also seating area."}
