{"title":"Carrefour Petrol Station","date":"2019-09-01T15:31:56.778Z","address":"Boulevard du Kent, 62231 Coquelles, France","review":"A lost business opportunity for Carrefour. It is a fully automated self catering petrol station. If you try to set it in English it stays in French and the machine also talks to you in a lot of French. I tried three times to get it into English without success. I  think I am experienced enough to assume it is a bug or English is not implemented. Lucky enough I had enough fuel left to fill up in Belgium."}
