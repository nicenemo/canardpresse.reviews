{"title":"Fosfelle Country House","date":"2019-08-30T06:01:30.807Z","address":"Bideford EX39 6EF, United Kingdom","review":"Nice appartement in a cottage in a farm. Well situated to explore the Hartland area.\nFriendly and relaxed owners. Nice eye for detail in decoration. Parrots an flowers in wallpaper, mugs and bedding.\n\nDogs are allowed but part of the apartment is carpeted.\n\nWhen the owner showed us in, the first thing we saw was 7 dead flies on the window sill. I know it is a farm, but there is no good reason for this. Check-in was at 15:00. We notified the owner months in advance that we would arrive much later because it just takes a long time to drive from Folkestone. So there was enough time to remove the flies.\n\nThe bed in the master bedroom is a bit small, ~140x180cm so not suitable for taller people. A larger bed would not fit in the room. We are not tall so we managed.\n\nThe bench in the living room was ultra soft. Which probably is known because of the surplus amount of cussions. It is very uncomfortable. There is a TV but because of the bench we did not really use it.\n\nIn the kitchen there are enough pans and cutlery to cook a decent meal. But beware of the fire alarm. Just toasting bread could set it off.\n\nThe toaster in the kitchen contained chunks of bread crust.\n\nThe kettle needs rescaling.\n\nThe pan handles need tightening.\n\nThe bathroom could use some rescaling and some parts are rusty."}
