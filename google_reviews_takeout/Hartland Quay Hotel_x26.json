{"title":"Hartland Quay Hotel","date":"2019-08-22T19:01:48.636Z","address":"Stoke, Hartland, Bideford EX39 6DU, United Kingdom","review":"Spectacular views. \n\nHowever, having a guy collecting a  Â£ 2,- parking fee in the afternoon but not in the morning and late afternoon. seems a bit silly. I think it only makes sense if he is a volunteer. Or is this a fraud?\n\n Cannot comment on the hotel or pub since we and our dog stay elsewhere. We were here in the early morning. We forgot our dog's drinking bowl on the parking area just beyond the parking guard.  So we collected that in the afternoon. Some of our pictures are from the coastal trail we walked this in the afternoon."}
