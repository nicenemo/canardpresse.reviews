But a lot nicer.\n\nProbably a bit similar to Brighton, Scheveningen or de Koog in atmosphere.   Fish and chips, ice cream etc. Also has an aquarium and the usual tourist shops with crap gifts made in China.\n\nNice parks on both sides on a hill and cliffs where you can avoid the crowds with a view of the city. You might encounter some local girls smoking marijuana."}
