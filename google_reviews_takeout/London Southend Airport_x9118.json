{"title":"London Southend Airport","date":"2018-09-01T17:28:34.395Z","address":"Southend-on-Sea SS2 6YF, United Kingdom","review":"On of the more relaxing airports of London. A one our train trip from London Liverpool Street station but 5 minutes walk  from station through security to a decent meal. Your order number is on a spoon at the Lakers restaurant, cute. There is also a coffee bar with pastry an power outlets with free WiFi. There is a Giraffe restaurant too like on other London airports. No big shopping mall like elsewhere. A &S. A Dixon's vending machine and a perfume and liquor store.  Southend  has the cleanest railway station I have ever seen. It has miraculous friendly security staff. I have experienced different elsewhere. No overview pictures of the departure hall inside as I promised a security chief. Later I discovered it can also be reached from Groningen airport the Netherlands."}
