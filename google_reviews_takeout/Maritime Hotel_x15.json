{"title":"Maritime Hotel","date":"2019-08-30T06:23:40.410Z","address":"Southwell Business Park, Portland DT5 2NA, United Kingdom","review":"Situated in an old naval complex in an industrial area, I am unsure whether I would stay again. Lots of things are broken or worn down.\n\nThe rooms are almost as hot as the London underground  Central Line. Outside temperature was 19-21 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe fan in the bathroom is rattling.\nThe airco ducts need cleaning. The airco hardly works and cannot be turned off. Also air treatment of the kitchen chimney and or nearby places makes the room noisy. It was room 321. Next door was the hotel plant. I assume airco for the whole hotel.\n\nThe bath was nice! The brand of showering gel and shampoo that was provided was good.\n\nThe shower is in the bad. The adjustable clamp that shower head cannot be fixed high, it keeps slipping to it's lowest position.\n\nThe filter in the bath faucet contained a a little stalagtite. Descaling seemed long overdue.  The kettle badly needed descaling too. However with the amount of chalk in the water a descaling installation on the water intake would make much more sense. We bought our own kettle and bottled water  for making tea and coffee.\n\nHaving the switch for the towel dryer labeled could save on energy.\n\nThe bathroom contained a mix of broken and working GU10 spot lights. Most are halogen lamps. Some replacements were LED. Halogen lights certainly add to the heat.\n\nThe beds feels unsturdy and you an feel the coils.  There is a big nice TV.\n\nThe hotel is dog friendly. Sadly the floor was covered with stained carpet.\n\nThe main elevator was not working. Probably this was the case for a while judging from the IKEA Billy bookshelf covering signage next to the elevator door on the second floor.\n\nWe did not try the restaurant, but it did not smell good."}
