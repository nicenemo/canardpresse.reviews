In general this is not true. Missed business opportunity. The venue is catering mainly to people traveling with the channel tunnel. Speaking good English might translate into more sales. There is no link from the French website to the English one on ..co.uk.  I accidentally googled that after first getting stuck on the French site.\n\nThis is especially true for the venue's guards. They told us in unfriendly rapid French that our dog was not allowed inside. They did not speak English. Since there was no signage telling that dogs were not allowed. Since I was not sure about whether they were real guards I emailed the venue. The clarified that dogs were not allowed unless you carried them in your arms or a bag. My remarks related to English support were ignored.\n\n Some people at Stake and Shake speak perfect English. Some are less comfortable with. Please, just try, I had to learn some French too in highschool.. In the next door Italian style restaurant the waiter did not speak English. I managed with my 2 year high school French. The Carrefour self catering fuel station claims to be able to work in English. It does not work. See separate review. For the other shops visited, I did not need communication or managed with a bit French."}
