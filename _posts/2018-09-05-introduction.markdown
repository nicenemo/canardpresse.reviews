We are **Hans and Angela Kruse** and we are here to share our passion for most likely restaurant food. Telling our story about what we've seen. Not only about the food but also about the entire experience. 

> A little disclaimer seems to be nessersarry. We are not professionals, just food lovers (We are level 6 and 8 at Google local guide). It's just our experience, our oppinion in that moment, this does not mean that you will experience the same thing or that a restaurant can't improve. 

We hope that you would like to go on this journey with us. 
we would also love hearing your story.
